  "description": "Access Outlook email via the browser relay — read, search, send, reply to emails and check calendar without separate auth. When IMAP is blocked and Microsoft Graph API requires admin consent you can't get, this is the third option: just open Outlook in Chrome, click the relay button, and your agent has full email access. Zero API keys, zero admin approval, zero config.",
