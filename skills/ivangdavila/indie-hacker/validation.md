# Validation Process

## Before Writing Code

### Step 1: Problem Confirmation (Day 1-2)
Find 5 real people with the problem:
- Search Twitter/Reddit for complaints about X
- DM 10 people, aim for 5 conversations
- Ask: "What do you use now? What's painful?"

**Red flag:** Can't find 5 people in 48 hours = too niche or non-problem.

### Step 2: Willingness to Pay (Day 3-5)
- "If this existed for $X, would you buy it?"
- Better: "Can I pre-sell it to you now?"
- Best: Actually collect payment

**Red flag:** "Sounds cool" without price discussion = hobby project.

### Step 3: Competition Analysis (Day 5-7)
- What exists? Why do people use it?
- What's wrong with existing solutions?
- Your wedge: why YOU win for THIS segment

**Red flag:** Incumbents solve it well enough = feature, not product.

## Validation Shortcuts

### For Side Projects
- Fake door test: landing page with signup
- Twitter poll (if you have audience)
- Gumroad pre-order

### Time Budget
- Max 2 weeks validation
- If unclear after 2 weeks, idea too vague — narrow scope

## Killing Ideas

When to kill:
- <50 people signed up to waitlist after 2 weeks promotion
- 0 paying pre-orders from 50+ conversations
- Every conversation requires education ("let me explain what this does...")

Post-mortem required for every killed idea (see `memory-template.md`).

## Common Validation Mistakes

- Asking friends (biased, won't pay)
- "Would you use..." instead of "Would you pay..."
- Building to validate instead of validating to build
- Targeting "everyone" instead of specific segment
- Ignoring existing solutions
