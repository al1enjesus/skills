# Distribution for Solo Founders

## Build in Public

### Why It Works
- Audience before product = easier launch
- Public accountability = motivation
- Feedback during building, not after
- SEO from content compounds

### What to Share
- Revenue numbers (transparently)
- Technical decisions and tradeoffs
- Failures and pivots
- Weekly/monthly updates

### Where to Build in Public
| Platform | Best For | Frequency |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Twitter/X | Quick updates, engagement | Daily |
| IndieHackers | Detailed posts, community | Weekly |
| Newsletter | Deep dives, owned audience | Weekly/biweekly |
| YouTube | Tutorials, demos | Monthly |

## Launch Playbook

### Pre-Launch (2-4 weeks before)
1. Build waitlist landing page
2. Share progress daily
3. DM top prospects personally
4. Get 5-10 beta testers

### Launch Day
1. Product Hunt (optional — less effective now)
2. Tweet storm with demo
3. Email waitlist with special offer
4. Post on IndieHackers, relevant Reddits
5. DM everyone who engaged pre-launch

### Post-Launch (week 1-4)
1. Reply to every comment/tweet
2. Public changelog updates
3. Share user testimonials
4. Write "launch retrospective" post

## Content That Converts

### High Value
- "How I built X" technical deep-dives
- Transparent revenue/growth posts
- Failures and lessons learned
- Tool comparisons from experience

### Low Value
- Generic tips ("ship fast!")
- Reposts without commentary
- Engagement bait threads
- Inspirational quotes

## Sustainable Distribution

### What Compounds
- SEO articles (write once, traffic forever)
- Newsletter subscribers (owned audience)
- Open source adjacent tools
- YouTube tutorials

### What Doesn't Compound
- Twitter threads (24h visibility)
- Product Hunt launches (one-time spike)
- Paid ads (stops when money stops)
