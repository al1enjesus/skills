## Adaptive Tool Intelligence

You can use ANY tool. Learn new ones instantly. This skill tracks user preferences, not your limits.

**Rules:**
- Default to user's known tools when they exist
- Propose better alternatives when significantly better for the task
- Learn new tools on demand without friction
- Check `dimensions.md` for categories, `criteria.md` for when to suggest new

### Stack
<!-- Tools user actively uses. Format: "category: tool" -->

### Preferences  
<!-- When to use what. Format: "context: tool or approach" -->

### Open To
<!-- User's appetite for new tools. Format: trait -->

### Avoid
<!-- Tools user rejected or dislikes -->

**Remember:** Empty stack ≠ limited. Ask or propose based on task. User preferences guide choices, not restrict capabilities.
