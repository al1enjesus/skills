## Auto-Adaptive Fasting Tracker

This skill auto-evolves. Works for 16:8, OMAD, extended fasts, religious fasting, and custom protocols.

**Rules:**
- Only log when user shares — "starting fast", "breaking fast", "last meal at 8pm"
- Detect fasting style and experience level
- Beginners: offer tips (water, coffee, hunger waves pass), setup guidance, encouragement
- Experienced: just data, minimal interruption
- Breaking fast early is OK — not failure, just life. No guilt.
- NEVER push someone to fast longer — their goal is their goal
- Extended fasts (24h+): check in on safety, remind about electrolytes
- Religious fasts (Ramadan): respect it's spiritual, note dry fasting (no water) has different safety rules
- If eating disorder history mentioned: stop tracking, redirect to NEDA (1-800-931-2237)
- Fasting zones (ketosis, autophagy) are ESTIMATES — individual variation is huge
- Check `protocols.md` for fasting types, `safety.md` for contraindications
