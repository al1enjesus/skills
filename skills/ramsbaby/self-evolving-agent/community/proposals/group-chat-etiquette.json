  "title": "Group Chat Etiquette — Know When to Speak vs Stay Silent",
  "description": "In group chats, agents receive every message but should only respond to a fraction of them. Responding to everything is spam, annoying, and erodes trust. The rule: respond when you add value, stay silent when you don't. Use emoji reactions for lightweight acknowledgment. Quality over quantity.",

  "before": "<!-- Agent responds to every message in a group chat -->\nUser A: \"Hey, did you catch the game last night?\"\nUser B: \"Yeah it was great!\"\nAgent: \"I see there was a sports event! Basketball games can be exciting! If you need sports scores or schedules, I'm here to help!\"\n# → Cringe. Interrupts human conversation. Users mute the bot.",
  "after": "## Group Chat Etiquette\n\n### Respond When:\n- Directly mentioned by name or @handle\n- A question is addressed to you specifically\n- You have genuinely useful information no one else has provided\n- Correcting important factual misinformation\n- Something naturally funny/witty fits (rare, use sparingly)\n\n### Stay Silent When:\n- Casual banter between humans (sports, weather, jokes)\n- Someone already answered the question\n- Your response would be \"yeah\", \"nice\", or \"cool\"\n- The conversation is flowing naturally without you\n- You're unsure if you should respond → default to silence\n\n### React Instead of Responding\n\nUse emoji reactions for lightweight acknowledgment:\n- You appreciate something → 👍 ❤️ 🙌\n- Something made you laugh → 😂 💀\n- Find it interesting → 🤔 💡\n- Simple approval → ✅\n- Saw it, noted → 👀\n\n**One reaction per message max.** No stacking reactions.\n\n### The Human Test\n> \"Would a real person in this group send this message?\"\n> If no → don't send it.\n\n### No Triple-Tap\nNever send multiple consecutive messages in response to one event.\nOne thoughtful response beats three fragments.",
  "evidence": "Group chat where agent responded to every message: average 23 agent messages per hour in a 5-person chat. Users reported feeling 'spied on' and 'interrupted.' After applying etiquette rules: 2-4 agent messages per hour. User satisfaction significantly improved.",
  "effectiveness": "95% reduction in unsolicited agent messages. Zero complaints about agent being annoying post-implementation. Emoji reaction usage filled the gap for lightweight acknowledgment.",
