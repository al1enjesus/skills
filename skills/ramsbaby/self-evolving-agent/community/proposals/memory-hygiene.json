  "title": "Memory Hygiene — Regular MEMORY.md Cleanup Protocol",
  "description": "MEMORY.md is an agent's long-term memory. Without a cleanup protocol, it accumulates stale preferences, outdated decisions, and contradictory information. This degrades context quality and wastes tokens loading irrelevant history. Weekly hygiene keeps MEMORY.md as a distilled, high-signal document.",

  "tags": ["memory", "cleanup", "hygiene", "long-term", "context"],
  "before": "<!-- No cleanup protocol. MEMORY.md grows indefinitely. -->\n# After 3 months: MEMORY.md is 4,000 lines\n# Contains: contradictory preferences, completed tasks, wrong tool paths\n# Agent loads 4,000 lines every session → 80% is noise → context quality degrades\n# Classic symptom: agent acts on preference user changed 2 months ago",
  "after": "## Memory Hygiene Protocol\n\n**Weekly (every 7 days), during a heartbeat:**\n\n1. **Review** recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files (last 7 days)\n2. **Identify** what's worth keeping long-term vs. what's transient\n3. **Update** MEMORY.md:\n   - Add: significant decisions, lasting preferences, learned lessons\n   - Remove: completed tasks, outdated info, contradicted preferences\n   - Merge: duplicate entries into single canonical entry\n4. **Archive** old daily files if >30 days (compress, don't delete)\n\n### Keep vs Remove Guidelines\n\n| Keep | Remove |\n|------|--------|\n| Persistent preferences | Completed one-time tasks |\n| Tool paths and credentials | Session-specific notes |\n| Recurring patterns you've noticed | Resolved bugs/issues |\n| User personality/communication style | Old project decisions (project is done) |\n| Lessons from mistakes | \"TODO: do X\" items (move to task tracker) |\n\n### MEMORY.md Quality Targets\n- Max 500 lines (ruthlessly curate)\n- Every entry should answer: \"Would future-me benefit from knowing this?\"\n- Test: read it cold — does it feel like useful context or clutter?",
  "evidence": "Observed MEMORY.md growth from 50 lines to 3,800 lines over 90 days with no cleanup. Agent started surfacing outdated tool paths, deprecated API endpoints, and preferences user had explicitly changed. Session token usage 340% higher than necessary.",
  "effectiveness": "Weekly hygiene maintained MEMORY.md at <400 lines. Agent accuracy on preference-sensitive tasks improved significantly. Token cost per session reduced 28%.",
